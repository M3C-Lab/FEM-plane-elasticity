# The exact solution:
# sigma_r_r = - pa * (b^2/r^2 - 1) / (b^2/a^2 - 1) - pb * (1 - a^2/r^2) / (1 - a^2/b^2)
# sigma_theta_theta = pa * (b^2/r^2 + 1) / (b^2/a^2 - 1) - pb * (1 + a^2/r^2) / (1 - a^2/b^2)
# tao_r_theta = 0
# where a = 2 is the inner radius, b = 4 is the outer radius,
# pa is the pressure on the inner circle, pa is the pressure on the outer circle.
